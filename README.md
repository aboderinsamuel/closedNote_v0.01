## 🧠 The Story

I got tired of re-engineering my "perfect ChatGPT prompts" every time I needed a particular kind of answer. Then my mum started doing the same thing. Then my grandma. Then my classmates.

Meanwhile, prompt engineers were dropping tips on X and Stack Overflow, but nobody had a good place to store, iterate on, and *remember* them.

So I built one, and added version control, because the best prompt you'll ever write is usually the fourth draft of something you thought was broken.

Beyond versioning, closedNote adds structure: organize into collections, chain into multi-step workflows, refine with AI, and import from any image via OCR, all private by default.

## ⚖️ How We Compare

## 🏗️ Architecture & Fault Tolerance

closedNote is a full-stack **Next.js 14** application backed by **Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)**. The core architectural goal is simple: **every feature that matters (writing, versioning, change tracking, searching, chaining) must feel instant, safe, and impossible to lose**.

### Versioning and Change Tracking (Core System)

- **Automatic version snapshots** are created only when content actually changes (no noisy duplicates).
- Every version is **comparable and restorable**, so you can experiment freely without fear of losing a working draft.

### Prompt Threads (Multi-step Workflows)

- **Threads** model prompts as ordered steps where each step can be refined independently.
- Each step has its **own version history**, so workflows evolve without breaking the whole chain.

### Search & Navigation (Fast Retrieval)

- A global **command palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`)** provides fast navigation across prompts, collections, and threads.
- Search is designed to keep your library usable even as it scales.

### Privacy and Security by Design

- **Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS)** enforces access control at the database layer.
- Every prompt, version, collection, and thread is strictly scoped to the authenticated user’s ID.

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Prompt Threads (Chains)

This is closedNote's biggest differentiator. Instead of writing one massive, brittle prompt, you can break complex tasks into discrete, testable steps. Chain prompts into multi-step workflows where each output feeds the next.

</p>

### 2. Version History (Git for Prompts)

Every edit is automatically snapshotted. Powered by Google's `diff-match-patch` algorithm, you get a visual, character-level diff of what changed (additions in green, removals in red) and one-click restoration without losing your timeline.

</p>

### 3. AI Refinement & Organization

Turn rough ideas into structured prompts using your own API keys. Group prompts into Collections, and instantly search your entire library via the `⌘K` command palette.

## ✅ All Features

- **Version History** - track every draft with a visual diff and one-click restore  
- **Prompt Threads** - link prompts into multi-step workflows where each output feeds the next  
- **OCR Import** - upload a screenshot or photo, extract the text, save it as a prompt  
- **Instant Search** - command palette (`⌘K`) across your entire library  
- **Collections** - group prompts by topic, project, or use case  
- **AI Refinement** - clean up rough ideas into polished, reusable prompts using your own API key  
- **One-Click Copy** - paste straight into ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or wherever you work  
- **Private by Default** - row-level security ensures your data is never accessible to others  
- **Dark Mode** - full theme support, system-aware  
- **Fully Responsive** - works on mobile without crying
